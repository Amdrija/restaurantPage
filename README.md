# Restaurant Page

This is a simple restaurant page made with HTML, CSS (scss) and JavaScript. It is using tabs to display different content, which is
dinamically rendered. As a consequence of this, once the page is loaded, we can switch between tabs instantly without having to
wait for the page to reload. This was done as an assignment from The Odin Project curriculum. It also uses webpack for importing and exporting.
